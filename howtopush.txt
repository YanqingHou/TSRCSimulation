error: The requested URL returned error: 403 Forbidden while accessing https://github.com/user/repo.git/info/refs

fatal: HTTP request failed
I know solve this error this way

git remote set-url origin https://username@github.com/user/repo.git
In this way , I must enter password.

$ git push origin master
Password: 
But I hate to enter password.
